Correct the grammar in the following sentence: She don't like apples. by moondream", "score": 80, "reason": "Grade: B. The response correctly identifies the error in the original sentence (lack of subject-verb agreement) and provides the corrected version: \"She doesn't like apples.\" Well done! However, I deduct 20 points because the explanation could be more detailed. For example, the response could have mentioned why \"don't\" is not the correct choice for a singular subject like \"she\"."}

The original sentence had one error, which was the possessive pronoun \"it's\". Since \"it\" is an object, it doesn't need to be possessive, and instead, the correct possessive form for a cat would be \"its\"."}
